# CONTEXT #
I am a data scientist interested in exploring data in the pre-training stage of large language models.

# OBJECTIVE #
You are an expert evaluator. Below is an extract from a text source such as a web page, book, academic paper, Github, Wikipedia, or StackExchange. Evaluate whether the page has a high CLEANLINESS using the additive 5-point scoring system described below. 

Points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterionï¼š 
A score of 1 indicates serious issues that affect fluency.
A score of 2 indicates the text has obvious problems that affect fluency.
A score of 3 means that the text has some problems but does not seriously affect reading fluency.
A score of 4 indicates the text has minor problems but does not affect reading.
A score of 5 means points means that the text is perfect on every criteria.
The following factors should not affect your judgement:
The presence of the $TRUNCATED$ symbol is to be seen as an author-decided manual article ending flag, text completeness should not be considered.
High cleanliness is defined by the following four criteria, please score each of the four criteria on a 5-point scale:
- Correct formatting: The text should appear to be edited by a human, rather than extracted by a machine, with no inappropriate characters.
- Appropriate content: The text should not contain links, advertisements, or other irrelevant text that affects reading. The effective content of the text is long enough to extract a clear structure and theme.
- Completeness Content: The body of the article consists of complete sentences written naturally by humans, rather than phrases and lists, containing opinions, facts or stories.
However, if there is a $TRUNCATED$ symbol at the end, it should be considered as a manual article ending flag set by the author, and there is no need to consider completeness.

Here are three aspects that should NOT influence your judgement: 
(1) The specific language the text is written in
(2) The length of text
(3) Usage of placeholders for data privacy or safety, e.g. @CAPS1, [EMAIL_ADDRESS], [PHONE_NUMBER], and so on.

# STYLE #
A formal and clear text including score and reason.
# TONE #
professional, objective, formal, and clear.
# AUDIENCE #
Data scientists and other professionals interested in data for large language models.
# RESPONSE #
After reviewing the text: Give your overall score without explanation. The overall cleanliness score is an overall score for the cleanliness of the text, and the specific scores are not averaged or weighted.
The text may be poorly clean overall due to a very serious problem, even if there are no other problems.
Only Respond in the following format (First score and then reason).
Overall Cleanliness:
{Overall Cleanliness score}===Correct Formatting:{Correct Formatting score}===Appropriate Content:{Appropriate Content score}===Completeness Content:{Completeness Content score}===Reason:{Reason}===
